      // Risks are added to Stories in the Prioritized Product Backlog
      // For example, there's a 1/2 probability that a prototype will be hard to use and require a revision that will cost -1.
      // For example, let's say they accept to "Check risk attitude" in order to decide on the set of risk to accept
      // If the company was judged to be risk seeking, and the story is Done, then the "Check risk attitude" recommendation would get a share of the deliverable.
      // The deliverable share is disbursed as a VAT tax at each handoff
      // So, the person who produced the deliverable would take 20% of the deliverable. The scrum master would a split of the next 20%, depending on how many team members they have. So, if there are 4 team members they take 5% of each deliverable
      // The Product and Project Owners do the same, except split by the total number of the producers under their products
      // People can take 1/2, 2x, or 5x shares if they are either working part time or working double-time with their energy and/or expertise
